C1. What areas of memory (heap or stack) are affected by the statement ?

C2. Does any memory get allocated or freed?
yes memory does get allocated but it does not get freed because there is no destructor
C3. If C2 is true then where is this memory?
it is line 11 and line 15
C4. Does the statement result in a memory leak?
there is a memory leak on line 14 because the line before it does the same thing.
