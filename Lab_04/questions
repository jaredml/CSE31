Q1.When you run the code, it fails to give the expected result, why?
There is an error with strcat because it adds world on to hello but the hello array doesnt have enough space for world.
Q2.What's one way to fix this bug?
I allocated memory by putting 13 in hello[].
Q3. How do you run a program in gdb?Why doesn't C provide the same kind of bounds-checking on arrays that Java does?
you have to compile the code using the debugger, then enter gdb with the executable file. in gdb type run.
Q4.What is a pro and a con for implementing strings as dumb arrays rather than smart objects like in Java?
