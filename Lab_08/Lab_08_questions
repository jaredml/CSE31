Q1. Find a positive floating point value x, for which x+1.0 = x. Verify
your result using fp.s and tell us the hex representation of x.
0x7f000000
Q2. Find the smallest positive floating point value x for which x+1.0
= x. State the hex representation of x.
0x4C000000
Q3. Determine a set of positive floating point numbers such that
adding these numbers in a different order can yield a different value.
You can do this using only three numbers. (Hint: Experiment with
adding up different amounts of the x value you determined in Q2, and
the value 1.0).
0x7f000000, 0x4C000000,0x3F800000
Q4. Based on your answer for Q3, do floating points obey associative
rule like integers?
No it does not obey associative rule.
